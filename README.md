# Code review project

Please take a look at `src/modules/albums/TopAlbumsList` folder. Let's assume that
files in that destination are about to be merged. Review that part of the code
and send us your feedback.

If you want, you can run the code from this repo. To do so just follow these steps:

1. Run `yarn install` command
2. Next run `yarn start`
3. Browser window should be opened automatically. If not go to `localhost:3000`
